    <H1>JS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS DAILY DISCUSSION</H1>

1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
The main difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, 
whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands

2. What is the spread operator?
- The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];


3. What are the differences between var, let and const?
var are in the function scope , hosting is allowed
let are in the block scope , can reassign the values
const are in the block scope, can reassign the values


4. What is execution context
The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution


5. What is creation phase and execution phase?
In the creation phase, the Execution Context is first associated with an Execution Context Object 
The Execution Context Object stores a lot of important data which the code in the Execution Context uses during its run-time


6. What is meant by first class functions
A programming language is said to have First-class functions if functions in that language are treated like other variables. 
So the functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned by another function. 
JavaScript treat function as a first-class-citizens. This means that functions are simply a value and are just another type of object.

<script>
    const Geek = (a, b) => {
        return (a + " " + b);
    }
      
    document.write(Geek("Akshit", "Saxena"));
</script>



7. What are closures? Give an example of closure
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. 
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time

function init() {
    var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
    function displayName() {
      // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
      console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
    }
    displayName();
  }
  init();
