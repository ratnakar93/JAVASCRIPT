1.What are promises and why do we need them?
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. 
They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.
    
    <script>
        var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
const x = "geeksforgeeks";
const y = "geeksforgeeks"
if(x === y) {
	resolve();
} else {
	reject();
}
});

promise.
	then(function () {
		console.log('Success, You are a GEEK');
	}).
	catch(function () {
		console.log('Some error has occurred');
	});

    </script>

2.What is the purpose of async/await keywords?
An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. 
The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains

<script>
    function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('resolved');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function asyncCall() {
  console.log('calling');
  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
  console.log(result);
  // expected output: "resolved"
}

asyncCall();
</script>

3.What is hoisting?
JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, 
prior to execution of the code. Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared

<script>
    // hoisting
function codeHoist(){
    a = 10;
    let b = 50;
}
codeHoist();
 
console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // ReferenceError : b is not defined
</script>

4.What is the DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. 
We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.


5.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN
Javascript null represents the intentional absence of any object value. 
The undefined property indicates that the variable has not been assigned a value or not declared at all. 
The NaN property represents a “Not-a-Number” value. The NaN property indicates that a value is not a legitimate number. 

6. How many operators do we have in JS ?
there are seven operators
Add, Substract, Multiply, Divide ,Modulus , Increment , Decrement

7.What is callback hell?
Callback Hell: Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. 
Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code

8.What is promise chaining
Promise chaining: Promise chaining is a syntax that allows you to chain together multiple asynchronous tasks in a specific order. 
This is great for complex code where one asynchronous task needs to be performed after the completion of a different asynchronous task

<script>
    const add = (a, b) => {     
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {        
        setTimeout(() => {            
            if (a < 0 || b < 0) {                 
                return reject('Numbers must be non-negative')
            } 
            resolve(a + b)         
        }, 2000) 
    })
}
  
add(1, 2).then((sum) => {     
    console.log(sum)  // Print 3   
    return add(sum, 4)
}).then((sum2) => {     
    console.log(sum2) // Print 7 
}).catch((e) => { 
    console.log(e) 
});
</script>

9.What are arrow functions?
Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. It allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions

10.Give an example of async/await
async makes a function return a Promise
await makes a function wait for a Promise

<script>
    let value = await promise;
    
    async function myDisplay() {
  let myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    resolve("I love You !!");
  });
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = await myPromise;
}

myDisplay();
</script>
